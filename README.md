:book: Search and view Wikipedia article snippets.

***

This project is part of the the Free Code Camp's [take-home projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-wikipedia-viewer/) curriculum. Here, you can search for a single or multi worded term and the Viewer will show all of the Wikipedia article snippets related to your term. You can then click one of the links to visit the related Wikipedia page.

You can view the project's website [here](https://carolinaknoll.github.io/wikipedia-viewer/).

To run the project locally, use your favorite command-line interface to type the following commands:

1. Clone it with `git clone git@github.com:carolinaknoll/wikipedia-viewer.git`
2. Go to the project's directory with `cd wikipedia-viewer`
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
4. Finally, start the project with `npm start`

The project was created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Though I now think using it was a bit overkill, it acted just like bicycle training wheels when I was just starting. As it is a simple project, I decided to leave it that way instead of refactoring it, since my most recent projects don't use it anymore and Create React App is still widely used by other people on their projects.
