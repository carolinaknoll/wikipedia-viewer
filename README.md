## Wikipedia Viewer

This is my Wikipedia Viewer project for the Free Code Camp's curriculum. For learning purposes, I chose to develop it using React.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so that I can deploy it to Heroku and have a live demo.

Please feel free to code review, as it will help me a lot!

Thank you.
